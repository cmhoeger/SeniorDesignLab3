         <p>
            Hello I'm JT AKA Josua Theodore, and I'm a 4th year Electrical Engineer at U of I. I was born in Bettendorf Iowa
            in the QuadCities, but I haven't lived there for around 12 years. Up until now I was living in Heidelberg
            Germany from 2010 to 2013 and then in Wiesbaden Germany from 2013 till the December 2021. My parents worked
            for the government so because of that I got to move around a lot when I was younger. My mom comes from Printess
            Mississippi and my dad comes from Athens Greece. I can speak English and Greek pretty well and I kind of know some
            German.
        </p><br>
         <p>
            I played football, wrestling, and track growing up in high school, and played against some german teams high school teams.
            I've been to 32 countries and counting
